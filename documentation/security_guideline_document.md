Here are a few options for what we can tackle next. Let me know which one (or combination) you’d like to dive into first:

1.  Security Guideline Document • A detailed, project-specific security playbook (authentication, RLS policies, input validation, encryption, etc.) • Supabase row-level security rules and JWT handling • Secure file-upload (OCR) and PDF export considerations
2.  Implementation Plan & Roadmap • Breakdown of epics, user stories, and sprint-level tasks • Timeline estimates for core features (profile management, meds entry, OCR, notifications) • Milestones for security reviews and testing
3.  Data Model & API Design • PostgreSQL schema for users, children, medications, dosing log, reminders • Supabase RLS policies and SQL examples • REST/GraphQL endpoint definitions and request/response shapes
4.  Authentication & Authorization • Supabase Auth setup and JWT lifecycle • Role-based access control design for multi-caregiver support • MFA options and session management best practices
5.  Notifications & Reminders Architecture • In-app, email, and SMS flow (e.g. Supabase Edge Functions, Twilio, SendGrid) • Scheduling engine design (cron jobs vs. serverless triggers) • Rate-limiting and retry logic
6.  OCR Integration & File Upload Security • Secure client/server file-upload pipeline • Google Cloud Vision API call flow with input sanitization • Malicious file prevention and storage best practices
7.  UI/UX Component Library & Security • React/Next.js folder structure and component breakdown • Secure form handling (client + server validation) • Accessibility and mobile-first considerations
8.  CI/CD & DevOps Security • Vercel deployment pipeline with environment secrets • Static analysis, SCA (dependency scanning), and automated tests • Monitoring, alerting, and roll-back strategies

Feel free to pick one or more items, or suggest another area you’d like to explore next!
